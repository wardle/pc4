# pc4-ms

This is an experiment using Fulcro as a front-end for pc4.

It is designed to be eventually equivalent to pc4-ward, and perhaps replace it.

This app was based on the [Fulcro template application](https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-template)
(commit 75367939f196eb591f712a2618d55b9a231f0cef from 19th September 2021).


To build

```shell
yarn install
```check

Start frontend compilation server:

```shell
yarn shadow-cljs watch main
```
