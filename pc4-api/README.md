# pc4-api

This is a simple java wrapper library that makes it easy to consume pc4 
functionality as a library in a java application. It is not designed for any other purpose.




#### Build an uberjar

A uberjar includes this library and all of its dependencies. 

It is only useful if you are incorporating this code into a project that
does not use modern dependency management.

```shell
clj -T:build uber
```
